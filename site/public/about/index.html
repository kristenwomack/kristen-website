<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Kristen üëãüèº</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an impact-driven product leader, technologist, and community builder. I&rsquo;m a creator for makers and builders ‚Äî developers, startups, and SMBs. I&rsquo;ve built three companies: Hack the Gap (acquired 2019) co-founded with Jenna Pederson; Mina (a marketplace for parents and birth professionals); and Night Sky Web Co (a technology services company building technical solutions and prototypes).</p>
<p>Currently, I am a Principal Product Manager at Microsoft leading the Azure Developer CLI (azd). I serve on the Board of Trustees for St. Catherine University, a higher education institution educating women to lead and influence, I am an advisor to the board of directors at Everyday Miracles, an organization focused in birth equity, and I teach after school intro to coding for 3rd to 8th graders.</p>
<p>Previously I was the Principal PM Manager of the Microsoft Graph Developer Experience team of product managers and content developers, building docs and tooling for working with the Microsoft Graph API, I was the head of product at LeadPages, the head of API platform and developer program at Best Buy, and worked on several API platforms and am a 3x founder.</p>
<p>I build products and teams and have a track record of transforming complex, abstract goals and ideas into actionable steps, and imbuing teams with the enthusiasm to tackle them. I&rsquo;ve been a natural leader since childhood, overflowing with ideas and recruiting others to bring them to life. I love nothing more than solving complex problems and bringing a vision to life. A natural ENTJ.</p>
<p>In my work life, this has translated into founding companies, building teams, launching products, leading departments (within scrappy startups and Fortune 500 companies), consulting, and serving as a board member and brand ambassador. My passion is building products and teams from the ground up, and leading with drive, vision, and fortitude.</p>
<p>My writing (on topics ranging from API development to team management) has appeared in publications including Runscope (acquired by CA Technologies) and Hitch (acquired by New Relic), and my work has been featured in the Star Tribune, Tech[dot]MN, Mpls-St. Paul Business Journal, MinneInno, Pioneer Press, and MAKE IT. MSP. I&rsquo;ve been a featured speaker and panelist at events hosted by Target, Product Development Management Association, The Nerdery, Film Society of Minneapolis St. Paul, and Twin Cities Startup Weekend Education, and I was chosen as one of the 2016 Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 40 Under 40.</p>
<p>Outside of work, my passions and hobbies include running, biking, yoga, reading, and camping. I am passionate about gender, birth, and reproductive justice. I love connecting with other parents, and helping them use their talent, passion, and skill to build a more equitable, joyful, creative, and compassionate world.</p>
