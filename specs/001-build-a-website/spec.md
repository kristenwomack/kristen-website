# Feature Specification: Professional Portfolio Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-website`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a website to organize my professional portfolio. Help me organize my talks and papers and where I've been referenced in media, articles, etc. Please group the links by date (reverse cron so people see the most recent first). I have a current website at www.kristenwomack.io and I'd like to move to a new website hosted on github pages (like with Hugo or Jekyll) or on Azure."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (but hosting options are relevant and must be clarified)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders and implementers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., hosting choice), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Hosting target (GitHub Pages via static generator vs Azure static/web app)
   - Import/upgrade approach from existing site (automated scrape, RSS feed, manual markdown import)
   - Content editing workflow (git-based markdown vs admin UI)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor to the site, I WANT to quickly discover Kristen Womack's most recent talks, papers, and media mentions, so I can assess current activity and access materials grouped by date (most recent first).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they view the "Recent" section, **Then** items are shown in reverse chronological order (newest first) across Talks, Papers, and Media.
2. **Given** a visitor clicks a Talk, **When** the talk detail page loads, **Then** the page shows talk date, event, abstract, slides link (if any), video link (if any), and related tags.
3. **Given** a new paper is added, **When** the site is rebuilt or the CMS entry is saved, **Then** the paper appears at the appropriate position in reverse chronological lists and the homepage summary updates.
4. **Given** a visitor filters by tag or year, **When** they apply the filter, **Then** results are shown correctly and remain ordered newest-first.
5. **Given** the site is built for GitHub Pages, **When** a push to the main/docs or gh-pages branch occurs, **Then** the site deploys successfully and the homepage is reachable at the configured domain.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when items lack a date? ‚Üí Items without explicit dates MUST surface under an "Undated" bucket and be clearly labeled; prefer requiring a date on submission ([NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accept undated items?]).
- How are duplicate media references handled? ‚Üí Deduplicate by canonical URL or DOI when available.
- How does the system behave when external links are unreachable? ‚Üí Links SHOULD open in new tabs and a link-checker job SHOULD flag dead links; UI may indicate last-checked date.
- Large media items (videos/slides) ‚Üí Host externally and embed or link; ensure performance and lazy-loading.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The site MUST present Talks, Papers, and Media Mentions as primary content types, each with dedicated listing pages and detail pages.
- **FR-002**: Listings MUST be grouped and ordered reverse-chronologically by date (newest first). Grouping by year with expand/collapse is PREFERRED for long histories.
- **FR-003**: The site MUST allow adding entries via markdown files in a content folder (e.g., /content/) or via a simple admin interface. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preferred authoring workflow - git/markdown vs CMS?]
- **FR-004**: The migration strategy from the existing site (`www.kristenwomack.io`) MUST be defined: options include automated content import (scrape/RSS), manual markdown conversion, or hybrid. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: provide access or export method for existing site content]
- **FR-005**: Hosting options MUST include a GitHub Pages workflow using a static site generator (Hugo or Jekyll). If Azure is chosen, provide CI/CD pipeline guidance to deploy to Azure Static Web Apps or Azure App Service. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: final hosting choice]
- **FR-006**: Each listing page and detail page MUST include metadata for SEO and social sharing (title, description, OG tags, canonical URL).
- **FR-007**: Provide tags, filters, and search (client-side for static site, or lightweight serverless API if needed) to filter by tag, year, type (Talk/Paper/Media), and keyword.
- **FR-008**: Accessibility baseline MUST meet WCAG AA for key pages (homepage, listing, detail pages).
- **FR-009**: Provide an RSS feed for recent items and sitemap.xml for SEO.
- **FR-010**: CI pipeline MUST run build and a set of checks: link-checker, accessibility audit (a11y lighthouse or axe), basic performance and unit test for any build scripts.
- **FR-011**: Performance target: homepage initial render p95 < 1s on a modern broadband connection; ensure images and embeds are optimized and lazy-loaded.
- **FR-012**: Authoritative content record: each entry MUST record source URL, publication date, and an optional canonical identifier (DOI, DOI-like). Duplicate detection SHOULD use canonical identifier when available.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-013**: If an admin UI is required, determine hosting and auth method [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: admin UI required? If yes, specify auth provider].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Talk**: date, title, event, location, abstract, slides_url, video_url, tags[], related_people[], notes, source_url
- **Paper**: date, title, venue/journal, DOI (optional), pdf_url, abstract, authors[], tags[], source_url
- **MediaMention**: date, title, outlet, excerpt, link_url, tags[], source_url
- **Tag**: name, slug
- **Person**: name, role (speaker/author), profile_link
- **SiteConfig**: site title, description, domain, analytics config, social links
